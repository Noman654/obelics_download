Data pipeline


# POC Ideas

As a quick POC, we will be working around the pipeline by OBELICS here: 
https://github.com/huggingface/OBELICS/tree/main 

The [folder](https://github.com/huggingface/OBELICS/tree/main/build_obelics) contains the files which needs to be executed in this order. 


# Setup

```
conda create -n mm python=3.8
conda activate mm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
